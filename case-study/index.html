        <p>In the Microinteractions (IDM241) class, the term project was to create or redesign a microinteraction that would be not only engaging but also convenient for users. The process of this project would be to build a microinteraction in three phases: alpha, beta, and final. I decided to redesign, and also further build out, a microinteraction on the Zara website. In this particular microinteraction, users would be able to scroll to view a product. They would then be able to hover over the product image to view a modal with the product name, description, and price. Clicking the ‘Quick View’ button within that modal would lead users to a separate and final modal that would display even more information about the product. This redesign would ultimately improve user experience as it is engaging, convenient, and informative.

        <p>The overarching goal of this project was to either redesign an existing microinteraction or create a new microinteraction. The timeline of this project was about 10 weeks, with 3 phases of the project spanning 2 to 3 weeks. The design and build of the microinteraction would be more complex with each subsequent phase. As this would be a project done individually, I took on the roles of both designing and developing the microinteraction. I decided to create a new microinteraction from scratch, drawing examples from different websites and further improving the design and build of each phase upon receiving feedback after having deliverables. For the design of the microinteraction of each phase, I used Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects to create reference images and animations of what I intended for the build to look like. I would also use HTML and CSS to create a web page for each assignment to describe the details of the microinteraction. As for the build of the microinteraction of each phase, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Once I grasped the purpose and goals of the project, the very first idea that came to mind was the Zara website. Zara is a Spanish clothing retailer based in Galicia, Spain. It is one of the biggest international fashion companies that draws in many customers through its extensive retail network. That being said, I remembered many instances when people would express their frustration using the Zara website. The current Zara website displays their products in a confusing and unorganized way, including videos, grid layouts, sporadic images on a single web page, making it difficult for users to view and learn about the products they may want to purchase. Although users are able to adjust the size and layout of the product images on the web page, a lot of these features can seem chaotic and overwhelming. Since the ultimate goal of this project was to build a microinteraction to improve user experience, I connected two and two together and decided to create a microinteraction that would allow users to gain a unique experience when viewing a product, learn more about the product including color and size options and more, and add the product to their cart efficiently.
